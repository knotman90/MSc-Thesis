<H2 id="sect:idleThreadsDevOccupancy"><A NAME="10_6">Device occupancy
 considerations</A></H2>
<P>Device occupancy is a crucial aspect of GPGPU CUDA when addressing
 the designing of efficient GPU applications. It is not possible to
 achieve high speedup if all the computation resources of the devices
 are not fully exploited and on the other hand it is easy to see that an
 over utilization leads to inefficient execution as well. The<EM> naïve
 implementation</EM> we have seen in section [sect:naiveImplementation],
 that always allocates as many threads as the dimension of the whole
 cellular space, most of the time over utilizes the device when
 there’s no need to, hence executing the model in a not optimal way.
 When considering a phenomenon (i.e., a lava flow) that is topologically
 connected (i.e., a simulation starts from few active cells and evolves
 by activating neighbour cells), the CA execution can be drastically
 accelerated restricting the application of the transition function to
 the only<EM> active</EM> cells<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95">
<SUP>95</SUP></A>.</P>
<P>In general the area interested by a lava flow is a growing portion
 (smaller) of the whole space, so there’s no need to allocate as more
 threads as the number of cells of the area, because no flow cannot be
 generated without lava presence. Allocated threads are resource
 demanding and consuming, and when the total number exceeds the number
 of processors they have to be scheduled serially, with the obvious
 consequences in terms of performance slowdown. For example, in the run
 of the model on a dataset coding Mt Etna’s 2006 eruption<A class="footnoteRef"
href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><SUP>96</SUP></A> (see figure
 [fig:etnaEruption1] ) the lava maximum expansion does not interest more
 than the
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(8\%\) of total cells are interested, meaning that the
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(92\%\) of threads are IDLE (those values hold even if the real event
 map is compared with the portion of the dataset taken in account by the
 cellular space).</P>

</P>

<P>An approach that dynamically adapts the grid of threads with the
 current lava distribution among cells may solve this issue, hence a
 serial (if any) thread execution is consequence of a real computation.
 Section [sect:RBBOptimization] and [sect:linearCellAtomic] present two
 different approaches that try to mitigate the problem of IDLE cells.</P>
