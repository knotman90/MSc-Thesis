<P>An important role is played, as seen before, by the interconnection
 network because provide mechanisms for data transfer between processing
 nodes. Typically they consist of<EM> n</EM> inputs and<EM> m</EM>
 outputs and are built in by switches and links (set of wires or fibers
 capable of carrying information<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6">
<SUP>6</SUP></A>).</P>

<P>A first classification can be done considering only if the nodes are
 connected directly to each others or not. In the first case the entire
 network consist of point-to-point links and they are called<STRONG><EM>
 static</EM></STRONG> or<STRONG><EM> direct</EM></STRONG> networks. On
 the other hand when the nodes are connected to each others using
 switches we talk about<STRONG><EM> indirect</EM></STRONG> networks.
 Because communication is an important task in parallel computing, the
 way the nodes are connected to each other is important and can
 influence the overall performance of the system that is determined by
 the capabilities of the network access devices, the level of control or
 fault tolerance desired, and the cost associated with cabling or
 telecommunications circuits. Networks topologies try to trade off cost
 and scalability with performance</P>
