<H2 id="openacc"><A NAME="6_3">OpenACC</A></H2>
<P>OpenACC is a new<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><SUP>
51</SUP></A> open parallel programming standard designed to enable to
 easily to utilize massively parallel coprocessors. It consist of a
 series of<EM> pragma</EM><A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52">
<SUP>52</SUP></A> pre-compiler annotation that identifies the succeeding
 block of code or structured loop as a good candidate for
 parallelization exactly like OpenMP <A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53">
<SUP>53</SUP></A> developed by a consortium of companies<A class="footnoteRef"
href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>. The biggest advantage
 offered by openACC is that the programmer does not need to learn a new
 language as CUDA or OpenCL require and does not require a complete
 transformation of existing code. Pragmas and high-level APIs are
 designed to provide software functionality. They hide many details of
 the underlying implementation to free a programmer’s attention for
 other tasks. The compiler is free to ignore any pragma for any reason
 including: it does not support the pragma, syntax errors, code
 complexity etc. and at the same time it has to provide profiling tool
 and information about the parallelization(even if it is possible).
 OpenACC is available both for C/C++ and Fortran. In this document we
 will concentrate only on C/C++ version. An OpenACC pragma can be
 identified from the string “#pragma acc” just like an OpenMP pragma
 can be identified from “#pragma omp”. The base concept behind
 openACC is the<EM> offloading</EM> on the accelerator device. Like CUDA
 or openCL the execution model is host-directed where the bulk of the
 application execute on CPU and just the compute intensive region are
 effectively offloaded on accelerator<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55">
<SUP>55</SUP></A>. The<EM> parallel regions</EM> or<EM> kernel regions</EM>
, which typically contains work sharing work such as loops are executed
 as kernel (concept described in section [kernels] at page ). The
 typical flow of an openACC application is orchestrated by the host that
 in sequence has to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>Allocate memory on device.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Initiate transfer.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Passing arguments and start kernel execution(a sequence of kernels
 can be queued).</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Waiting for completion.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Transfer the result back to the host.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Deallocate memory.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each of the action above there is one or more directive that
 actually implements the directives and a complete set of option permit
 to tune the parallelization across different kind of accelerators. For
 instance the<EM> parallel</EM> directive starts a parallel execution of
 the code above it on the accelerator, constricting<EM> gangs</EM> of
 workers (once started the execution the number of gangs and workers
 inside the gangs remain constant for the duration of the<EM> parallel</EM>
 execution.) The analogy between the CUDA blocks and between workers and
 cuda threads is clear and permit to easily understand how the work is
 effectively executed and organized. It has a number of options that
 permits to for example copy an array on gpu to work on and to copy back
 the result on the host side.</P>
<P>The syntax of a OpanACC directive is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>C/C++ : #pragma acc directive-name [clause [[,] clause]…] new-line.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Fortran : !$acc directive-name [clause [[,] clause]…]</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Each clause can be coupled with a number of clauses that modify the
 behavior of the directive. For example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>copy( list )Allocates the data in list on the accelerator and copies
 the data from the host to the accelerator when entering the region, and
 copies the data from the accelerator to the host when exiting the
 region.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>copyin( list ) Allocates the data in list on the accelerator and
 copies the data from the host to the accelerator when entering the
 region.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>copyout( list ) Allocates the data in list on the accelerator and
 copies the data from the accelerator to the host when exiting the
 region.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>create( list ) Allocates the data in list on the accelerator, but
 does not copy data between the host and device.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>present( list ) The data in list must be already present on the
 accelerator, from some containing data region; that accelerator copy is
 found and used.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
