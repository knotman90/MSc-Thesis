<P>GPGPU, acronym for General-purpose computing on graphics processing
 units, is a recent phenomenon wich consist in the utilization of a
 graphics processing unit (GPU<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9">
<SUP>9</SUP></A>), which typically handles computation only for computer
 graphics and was optimized for a small set of graphic operation, to
 perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the
 central processing unit (CPU). Those operations (generation of 3D
 images) are intrinsically parallel, so, is not surprising if the
 underlying hardware has evolved into a highly parallel, multithreaded,
 and many-core processor. The GPU excels at fine grained, data-parallel
 workloads consisting of thousands of independent threads executing
 vertex, geometry, and pixel-shader program threads concurrently.
 Nowadays, the GPUs are not limited to its use as a graphics engine;
 there is a rapidly growing interest in using these units as parallel
 computing architecture due to the tremendous performance available in
 them. Currently, GPUs outperform CPUs on floating point performance and
 memory bandwidth, both by a factor of roughly 100
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@NvidiaprogGuide], easily reaching computational powers in the order of
 teraFLOPS. GPU works alongside the CPU providing an heterogeneous
 computation, simply offloading compute-data-intensive portion of
 program on GPU using it as co-processor highly specialized in parallel
 tasks. Plus since 2006, date when Nvidia has introduced CUDA, is
 extremely simple to program these kind of devices for general purpose
 tasks, although before that date this goal was achieved dealing
 directly with the graphic API using shaders with all the related
 constraints such as lack of integers or bit operations.</P>
