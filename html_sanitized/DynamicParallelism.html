<H3 id="DynamicParallelism"><A NAME="5_3_4">Dynamic Parallelism</A></H3>
<P>Cuda 5.0 introduces a new feature,<EM>Dynamic Parallelism</EM>
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@dynamicParallelism]<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><SUP>
39</SUP></A> that enable CUDA kernel to create new work, using the API
 to launch new kernel, perform device memory management, or library call
 (CUBLAS for instance) all without CPU involvement (see example code
 [code:dynamicParallelism] at page ). This effectively eliminates the
 superfluous back and forth communication between the GPU and CPU
 through nested kernel computations. The launching kernel is called the
 “parent”, and the new grid it launches the “child”. Child
 kernels may themselves launch work, creating a nested execution
 hierarchy<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
 and giving the possibility to easily exploit and port parallel nested
 algorithms or other constructs that do not fit a flat, single-level of
 parallelism. To be considered complete, a parent kernel all child grids
 created by its threads(whichever it is within the kernel) have
 completed, even if the programmer does not explicitly synchronize the
 threads the runtime guarantee synchronization between parent and all
 the childs ( see figure [dynamicparallelismParentChild] and
 [dynamicParallelismSynch]). In the example in figure
 [dynamicParallelismSynch] the kernel C will not be able to begin
 execution until kernel Z has completed, because from the point of view
 of C, kernels X,Y,Z are seen as part of B.</P>

<P>The same kind of coordination and synchronization holds between
 X,Y,Z, hence Y can’t begin the execution until X has returned. This
 allow the program flow can be handled “on GPU” within one single
 kernel without any memory exchange between GPU and CPU, and also allow
 hierarchical call to be written where data from a parent kernel is used
 to decide how to partition the next lower level of the hierarchy (see
 figure [dynamicparallelismParentChild]) .</P>
<P>Consistency of global memory access is not guarantees between child
 and parent, because as usual launches are asynchronous and it means
 that when a child grid is invoked it return immediately the control to
 the parent kernel, and the parent does not know when child is really
 executed. So it can not rely on any assumption about the concurrent
 execution of the child. There are just two point in the execution of a
 child grid when the memory is fully consistent with the parent:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>when a child is invoked.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>when the launching thread reaches a synchronization point.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Moreover childs and parent grid share the same global and constant
 memory, but as kernels, have different and private local registers and
 shared memory. It’s illegal to use a pointer to local or shared
 memory as an argument to a kernel launch.</P>
