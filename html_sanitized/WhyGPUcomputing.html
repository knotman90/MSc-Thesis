<P>Traditionally performance improvements in computer architecture have
 come from cramming ever more functional units onto silicon, increasing
 clock speeds and transistors number. Moores law
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@mooreLaw1965] states that the number of transistors that can be placed
 inexpensively on an integrated circuit will double approximately every
 two years.</P>

<P>Coupled with increasing clock speeds CPU performance has until
 recently scaled likewise. But this trend cannot be sustained
 indefinitely or forever. Increased clock speed and transistor number
 require more power and generate more heat. Although the trend for
 transistor densities has continued to steadily increase, clock speeds
 began slowing circa 2003 at 3 GHz. If we apply Moore’s law type
 thinking to clock-speed performance, we should be able to buy at least
 10 GHz CPUs. However, the fastest CPU available today is 3.80 GHz At
 same point the performance increase fails to increase proportionally
 with the added effort in terms of transistors or clock speed because
 efficient heat dissipation and increasing transistor resolution on a
 wafer becomes more important and challenging (there will be still the
 physical limit of dimension for each transistor, the atom). The heat
 emitted from the modern processor, measured in power density</P>

<P>But the power demand did not stop in these year, here the necessity
 of switching on parallel architectures, so today the dominating trend
 in commodity CPU architectures is multiple processing cores mounted on
 a single die operating at reduced clock speeds and sharing some
 resources. Today is normal to use the so-called multi-core (2,4,8,12)
 CPUs on a desktop PC at home.</P>
