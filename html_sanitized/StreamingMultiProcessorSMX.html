<P>The SM is the heart of NVIDIA unified GPU architecture. Most of the
 key hardware units for graphics processing reside in the SM. The SM
 CUDA cores perform pixel/vertex/geometry shading and physics/compute
 calculations. Texture units perform texture filtering and load/store
 units fetch and save data to memory. Special Function Units (SFUs)
 handle transcendental and graphics interpolation instructions. There
 are eight SMX in GeForce GTX 680 instead of sixteen as in the GTX580).</P>

<P>To feed the execution resources of SMX, each unit contains four warp
 schedulers, and each warp scheduler is capable of dispatching two
 instructions per warp every clock. More importantly, the scheduling
 functions have been redesigned with a focus on power efficiency. For
 example: Both Kepler and Fermi schedulers contain similar hardware
 units to handle scheduling functions, including, (a) register score
 boarding for long latency operations (texture and load), (b) inter-
 warp scheduling decisions (e.g., pick the best warp to go next among
 eligible candidates), and (c) thread block level scheduling (e.g., the
 GigaThread engine); The SMX schedules threads in groups of 32 parallel
 threads called warps. Each SMX features four warp schedulers and eight
 instruction dispatch units, allowing four warps to be issued and
 executed concurrently. Keplerâ€™s quad warp scheduler selects four
 warps, and two independent instructions per warp can be dispatched each
 cycle. All cores in a multiprocessor have on-chip shared resources,
 including 255 local 32- bit registers per thread and one on-chip fast
 memory of size 64Kbyte, which enable threads cooperation and
 transparent caching<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><SUP>

 on-chip shared memory has very low access latency and high bandwidth
 similar to an L1 cache; it holds CUDA variables for the active thread
 blocks. The shared memory allows the parallel threads run on the cores
 in a MP to share data without sending it over the system memory bus.</P>
