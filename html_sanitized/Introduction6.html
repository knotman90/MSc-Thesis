<P>Parallel computing is a cost-effective method for efficient
 resolution of problems and was used as tool for modeling real complex
 phenomena like a lava flow, or snowflakes. Many techniques were
 developed in order to exploit the power of parallelization differing
 from each other primarily for the underlying parallel architecture they
 are designed for (see chapter [chap:parallelArchitectures]). In this
 work we adopted GPUs to accelerate the SCIARA-fv3 lava flow (see
 section [sect:SCIARA_MODEL])cellular automata model<A class="footnoteRef"
href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><SUP>82</SUP></A> following the APOD
 parallelizing methodology (see section [sect:APOD]) and hence,
 different parallel versions of the model were produced, incrementally
 adopting new features and strategies in order to achieve better
 performances.</P>
<P>The versions produced have been:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><EM>Naïve implementation :</EM></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
<BR> A basic and simple porting consisting in mapping each cell of the
 cellular space to a CUDA thread. Most part of the scaffolding code was
 produced here because all the algorithms and data structures, used in
 the serial code, that have prevented the parallelism have been
 identified and handled (see section [sect:topLevelStrategies] and
 [sect:naiveImplementation]) .</P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><EM>Rectangular Bounding Box - RBB:</EM></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
<BR> A first important optimization strategy was adopted here in order
 to mitigate the problem of IDLE allocated threads (see section
 [sect:idleThreadsDevOccupancy]), that limits the occupancy of the
 device. The computation is limited only within the boundaries of a
 rectangle that has the property of containing all the active cells (see
 sections [sect:serialoptimization] and [sect:RBBOptimization] )</P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><EM>Shared memory utilization:</EM></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
<BR> A deep analysis on memory accesses was performed to select buffers
 and variables more often accessed in kernel code in order to take
 advantage of the shared memory (see sections [shareMemory] and
 [sect:sharedMemoryOptimization])</P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><EM>Atomic function implementation:</EM></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
<BR> A family of two versions exploiting CUDA<EM> atomic functions</EM>
 was developed as solution to the problem of race-conditions while
 distributing flows among cells (see algorithm [alg:distribution])</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P><STRONG><EM>RBB-atomic</EM></STRONG> : A porting of the RBB version
 introduced before without utilizing the flow’s substates (see section
 [sect:raceCondAvoiding]) for lava flow distribution.</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P><STRONG><EM>List active cells and atomic functions</EM></STRONG> :
 IDLE cells and related IDLE threads have been found to be the most
 prominent limiting factor in exploiting GPU power. This version
 implements a mechanism that tries to avoid almost completely this
 issue, showing very good improvements in performances (see section
 [sect:linearCellAtomic]).</P>
