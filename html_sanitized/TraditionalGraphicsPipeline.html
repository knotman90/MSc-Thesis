<H3 id="graphicPipeline"><A NAME="4_3_1">Traditional Graphics Pipeline</A>
</H3>
<P>A graphics task such as rendering a 3D scene on the GPU involves a
 sequence of processing stages (i.e. shaders) that run in parallel and
 in a prefixed order, known as the graphics hardware pipeline<A class="footnoteRef"
href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> (see Figure
 [graphicPipeline]).</P>
<P>The first stage of the pipeline is the vertex processing. The input
 to this stage is a 3D polygonal mesh. The 3D world coordinates of each
 vertex of the mesh are transformed to a 2D screen position. Color and
 texture coordinates associated with each vertex are also evaluated. In
 the second stage, the transformed vertices are grouped into rendering
 primitives, such as triangles. Each primitive is scan-converted,
 generating a set of fragments in screen space. Each fragment stores the
 state information needed to update a pixel. In the third stage, called
 the fragment processing, the texture coordinates of each fragment are
 used to fetch colors of the appropriate texels (texture pixels) from
 one or more textures. Mathematical operations may also be performed to
 determine the ultimate color for the fragment. Finally, various tests
 (e.g., depth and alpha) are conducted to determine whether the fragment
 should be used to update a pixel in the frame buffer. Each shader in
 the pipeline performs a basic but specialised operation on the vertices
 as it passes. In a shader based architecture the individual shader
 processors exhibit very limited capabilities beyond their specific
 purpose. Before the advent of CUDA in 2006 most of the techniques for
 non-graphics computation on the GPU took advantages of the programmable
 fragment processing stage. The steps involved in mapping a computation
 on the GPU are as follows:</P>

<P>Each computation step is implemented with a user-defined fragment
 program. The results are encoded as pixel colors and rendered into a
 pixel-buffer<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><SUP>12</SUP>

<P>Results that are to be used in subsequent calculations are copied to

<P>The year 2006 marked a significant turning point in GPU architecture.
 The G80 was the first NVidia GPU to have a unified architecture whereby
 the different shader processors were combined into unified stream
 processors. The resulting stream processors had to be more complex so
 as to provide all of the functionality of the shader processors they
 replaced. Although research had been carried out into general purpose
 programming for GPUs previously, this architectural change opened the
 door to a far wider range of applications and practitioners. More in
 detail GPU are well-suited for problems highly data-parallel in wich
 the same code is executed on many data elements at the same time (SIMD
 paradigm<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
 or more generally as a CRCW PRAM machine<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14"
id="fnref14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>).</P>
