<H2 id="c-accelerated-massive-parallelism-c-amp"><A NAME="6_4">C++
 Accelerated Massive Parallelism (C++ AMP)</A></H2>
<P><STRONG>C++ AMP</STRONG><A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58">
<SUP>58</SUP></A> is a family of tools developed by Microsoft, first
 announced in 2011. It is aiming to significantly lower the barrier to
 entry parallel programming by providing a mainstream C++ option that we
 are calling “<EM>C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism</EM>” or “<EM>
C++ AMP</EM>” for short.</P>
<P>C++ AMP introduces a key new language feature to C++ and a minimal
 STL-like library that enables you to very easily work with large
 multidimensional arrays to express your data parallel algorithms in a
 manner that exposes massive parallelism on an accelerator, such as the
 GPU. It is part of<EM> Visual C++</EM> compiler and of Visual Studio
 tool.</P>
<P>Microsoft’s implementation targets Windows by building on top of
 the ubiquitous and reliable Direct3D platform, and that means that in
 addition to the performance and productivity advantages of C++ AMP, you
 will benefit from hardware portability across all major hardware
 vendors. The core API surface area is general and Direct3D-neutral,
 such that one could think of Direct3D as an implementation detail; in
 future releases, we could offer additional implementations targeting
 other kinds of hardware and topologies (e.g., cloud).</P>
<P>Once you build your C++ AMP code, it will be able to execute on any
 DirectX 11 device or newer, from any major hardware vendor, and
 fallback to the CPU if necessary. For example this is how the vector
 addition example looks in C++ AMP:</P>
<PRE><CODE>#include &lt;vector&gt;
	  #include &lt;amp.h&gt;
	  void example_amp(const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; v1, const std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; v2, std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; v3)
	  {
	    concurrency::array_view&lt;const int&gt; av1(v1.size(), v1);
	    concurrency::array_view&lt;const int&gt; av2(v2.size(), v2);  
	    concurrency::array_view&lt;int&gt; av3(v3.size(), v3);  
	
	    // add pairs of elements in v1 and v2 into v3 in parallel 
	    concurrency::parallel_for_each(av3.grid, [=] (concurrency::index&lt;1&gt; idx)  restrict(direct3d)
	   {
	     av3[idx] = av1[idx] + av2[idx]; 
	   });
	
	   av3.synchronize();
	 }</CODE></PRE>
<P>Lines 5 through 7 (<CODE>concurrency::array_view</CODE>) create array
 views on top of the std::vectors which were passed into the function.
 GPUs typically have their own memory and wrapping your CPU-side arrays
 or STD vectors in an array view is required in order to make the data
 accessible on the GPU. Then, C++ AMP copies data as necessary between
 the CPU and the GPU, in a mostly automatic fashion. Like an <CODE>
std::vector</CODE> or an <CODE>std::array</CODE>, class <CODE>
concurrency::array_view</CODE> is a template on the element type. Lines
 9 through 13 contain an invocation of <CODE>parallel_for_each</CODE>.
 This newly added overload of <CODE>parallel_for_each</CODE> is the
 method using which C++ AMP injects parallelism into your program (well,
 not the only one). This instruction take some parameters like how many
 logical threads have to be allocated in launching the parallel code and
 what their numerical thread ID’s are going to be. The body of the
 lambda function is just a single line that actually performs the sum
 addition, and it is here that the “parallel” code is specified.</P>
<P>Microsoft is offering C++ AMP in order to ease the entry into the
 massive parallelism world by hiding current and future hardware
 differences and by making it a first class feature of Visual C++, and
 by working with industry partners to make it an open specification.</P>
