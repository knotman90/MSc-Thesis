<P>This type of network topology is based on a hierarchy of nodes. The
 highest level of any tree network consists of a single node, the “<EM>
root</EM>” that connects nodes (a fixed number referred to as the
 “branching factor”<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><SUP>
8</SUP></A> of the tree) in the level below by point-to-point links.
 These lower level nodes are also connected to nodes in the next level
 down. Tree networks are not constrained to any number of levels, but as
 tree networks are a variant of the bus network topology, they are prone
 to crippling network failures should a connection in a higher level of
 nodes fail/suffer damage. This topology exhibits good scalability and
 thanks to the different levels makes fault identification and isolation
 easier but the maintenance may be an issue when the network spans a
 great area.</P>
