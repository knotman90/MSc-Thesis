<P>Parallel computing has a tremendous impact on various areas, raging
 from scientific computation or simulation, commercial and industrial
 application and data mining. Lot of effort has put during these years
 in order to try to mitigate and overcome the limits regarding the
 sequential computer architecture. In particular sequential architecture
 consist of three main components:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>Processor</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Memory</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>Communication system (datapaths, usually buses)</P>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>All three components present bottlenecks that limit the overall
 computing rate of a system. Caches, low-latency high bandwidth and
 small capacity storage, for example can hide latency of DRAM chips
 storing the fetched data and serving subsequent requests of the same
 memory location<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><SUP>1</SUP>
</A>. But one of the most important innovation that addresses these
 bottlenecks is multiplicity (in processor, memories and dataphats) that
 allows to extend the class of tractable problems with larger instances
 and more cases that can be handled. It is so popular that even
 smartphones are multicore; Iphone 4S is 2-core, and nexus 4 is 4-core.
 This multiplicity has been organized in several manners during the
 years giving birth to a variety of architectures. Here a brief
 classification of the most important ones.</P>
