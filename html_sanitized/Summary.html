<P>In this thesis, a parallel version of the new numerical SCIARA-fv3
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@Spataro2010] model was implemented using different GPGPU strategies,
 specifically, by adopting the NVIDIA Compute Unified Device
 Architecture (CUDA)
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@NvidiaprogGuide] framework in order to improve the overall execution
 time. Following the APOD (see section [sect:APOD]) developing strategy,
 different versions were produced, incrementally adding new features and
 using more sophisticated CUDA APIs at each developing cycle. Starting
 from a naive porting (see section [sect:naiveImplementation])
 consisting in a one thread one cell over the whole cellular space, a
 LAC version (see section [sect:linearCellAtomic] was developed, that
 showed best speedups and occupancy (
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
\(\eta\)) values. Atomic functions (see sections
 [sect:atomicImplementation]) were also exploited as an alternative
 solution to the non race-condition free flow distribution algorithm
 (see section [sect:raceCondAvoiding]). Tests and numerical analysis
 were performed in order to understand how to maximize the utilization
 of the available devices and to validate the parallel model
 implementations. Numerical approximation and error propagation were
 also deeply investigated.</P>
<P>Eventually, a new CUDA C library for CCA were designed, currently in
 beta-version, permitting an easy parallel programming of CCA for
 researchers that are not GPGPU experts to effortlessly write and
 execute their CCA models.</P>
