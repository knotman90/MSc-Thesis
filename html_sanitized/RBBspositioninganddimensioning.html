 positioning and dimensioning</A></H4>
<P>One of the greater problem in addressing this kind of cellular space
 management is to choose how many RBBs have to be utilized and the
 position of each of them in order to minimize the number of idle cells.
 This implies an obvious overhead due to extra time spent in optimizing
 their position. A preliminary adopted solution is to test position of
 each RBB at different offsets from the beginning of the cellular space,
 and choose the combination that guarantees the minimum number of IDLE
 cells. Another problem can arise from the fact that a cell may be
 activated at the same step from two cells belonging to two different
 RBB, with the consequence of determining which RBB should take
 responsibility of the newly activated cell.</P>

\(\eta\) was monitored utilizing up to 4 RBB at the same time, and good
 results has appeared (see figure [fig:RBBcomparision]).</P>
