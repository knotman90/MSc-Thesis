<H3 id="wolframs-classification"><A NAME="7_5_2">Wolfram’s
 classification</A></H3>
<P>Mathematical analysis of CA may be not so straightforward despite
 their simple definition. A first attempt to classify CA was attempted
 by Wolfram
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@wolfram2002]. He proposed a set of four classes for CA classification
 that are the most popular method of CA classification, but they suffer
 from a degree of subjectivity. Classification is based only on visual
 valuations, that are obviously subjective. A more rigorous definition
 of these classes is given in <A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71">
<SUP>71</SUP></A>
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@culik1998]. Here the four Wolfram’s classes.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>these CA have the simplest behavior; almost all initial conditions
 result in the same uniform initial state (homogeneous state).</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>different initial conditions yield different final patterns, but
 these different patterns consist of an arrangement of a certain set of
 structures, which stays the same forever or repeats itself within a few
 steps(periodic structures).</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>behavior is more complicated and appears random, but some repeated
 patterns are usually present (often in the form of triangles)(chaotic
 pattern).</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>in some respects these are the most complicated class; these behave
 in a manner somewhere in between Class II and III, exhibiting sections
 both of predictable patterns and of randomness in their pattern
 formation(complex structures).</P>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>He observed that the behavior of a meaningful class of Cellular
 Automata by performing computer simulations of the evolution of the
 automata starting from random configurations. Wolfram suggested that
 the different behavior of automata in his classes seems to be related
 to the presence of different types of attractors.</P>
<P>In figures [class12] and [class34] some elementary automata divided
 in their classes.<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><SUP>
72</SUP></A></P>
<P>
<BR></P>
<P>We can well see from these examples that automata from class 1 have
 all cells ending up very quickly with the same value, in a homogeneous
 state and automata from class 2 with a simple final periodic patterns.
 Class 3 appear to be chaotic and non-periodic and automata from class 4
 have a mixed behaviour, complex-chaotic structures are locally
 propagated.</P>
