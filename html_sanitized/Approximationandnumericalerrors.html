Approximation and numerical errors</A></H3>
<P>Validation of the parallel models has been tricky also due to
 differences (at first sight unexpected) in substate values that were
 not caused by implementation errors. It has been seen that, different
 runs of the “<EM>atomic</EM>” version, showed errors growing in the
 course of CA execution. The source of errors resides in the order of
 execution of the operations of sums and multiplications, that is
 completly out of control of the programmer in this “<EM>atomic</EM>
”-based version. In fact, CUDA atomic operations ensure “thread
 safe” accesses to variables, but the order in wich they take place is
 unknown. It is well known that
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(A+(B+C) \neq (A+B)+C\) in the general case holds (floating-point
 operations, as defined in the IEEE-754 standard, are not associative),
 and that the ordering of large numbers of operations (such as
 summations) that deal with operands of substantially different
 magnitudes can significantly affect the final result
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
 [@Villa_effectsof]<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn108" id="fnref108"><SUP>
108</SUP></A>. On massively multi-threaded systems, the
 non-deterministic nature of how machine floating point operations are
 interleaved, combined with the fact that intermediate values have to be
 rounded or truncated to fit in the available precision leads to
 non-deterministic numerical error propagation. This is the case of
 SCIARA-fv3 where for a cell
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(c\) this kind of error propagates for hundred of thousands steps,
 making it big enough to be relevant in computing substate values.
 Problems of this kind have comed out in this version of the model
 because it is much more numerical sensitive, being more physically
 accurate in modelling the flows. The problem, hence, does not derive
 from the parallel implementation and to confirm this hypothesis another
 order of execution of the distribution phase was tested on the
 sequential version (seen in listing [code:skypIdleCell]), simply
 swapping the two <CODE>for</CODE> statements of the cells general loop
 and comparing the result after a certain number of steps with the
 original version. Even the sequential implementation show the same
 numerical problems.</P>
<P>The magnitude of this error was investigated and results showed
 (using the dataset of Mt Etna) that after
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(350000\) steps the
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\cong80\%\) of the cells had and error less or equal to the
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(10\%\) respect to the sequential version, meaning a difference of the
 order of
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(10^{-2}\;m\). However, in the context of complex macroscopic
 phenomena, and in particular in context of lava flow simulation, errors
 of this kind are insignificant.</P>
