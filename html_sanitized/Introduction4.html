<P>Nowadays most of the basic natural phenomena are well described and
 known, thanks to the effort of lots of scientist that studied the basic
 physic’s laws for centuries; for example, the freezing of water or
 the conduction that are well know and qualitative analyzed. Natural
 system are usually composed by many parts that interact in a complex
 net of causes/consequences that is at least very difficult but most of
 the times impossible to track and so to describe. Even if the single
 component are each very simple, extremely complex behavior emerge
 naturally due to the cooperative effect of many components. Much has
 been discovered about the nature of the components in natural systems,
 but little is known about the interactions that these components have
 in order to give the overall complexity observed. Classical theoretical
 investigations of physical system have been based on mathematical
 models, like differential equations, that use calculus as tool to solve
 them, which are able to describe and allow to understand the phenomena,
 in particular for those that can be described by which are linear
 differential equation<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><SUP>
59</SUP></A> that are easy solvable with calculus. Problems arise when
 non-linear differential equations come out from the modellation of the
 phenomena, like fluid turbulence<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60">
<SUP>60</SUP></A>. Classical approach usually fails to handle these kind
 of equations due to the too high number of components, that make the
 problem intractable even for a computer based numerical approach.
 Another approach to describe such systems is to distill only the
 fundamental and essential mathematical mechanism that yield to the
 complex behavior and at the same time capture the essence of each
 component process. Cellular automata are a</P>

 modellation and simulation of a wide class of systems, in particular
 those ones constructed from<STRONG> many identical</STRONG> components,
 each (ideally) simple, but together capable of complex behaviour
