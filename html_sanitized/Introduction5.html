<P>As stated in the section [cellularAutomataIntroduction] cellular
 automata are a very powerful tool for modelling complex-systems and
 they were adopted as modelling and simulation paradigm in a wide range
 of applications like fluid-dynamical phenomena, gas models
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
 [@Frisch1986], or lattice Boltzmann model
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
 [@Chopard1999]. The behavior of those physical systems is well
 described by the basic laws of continuum mechanics (Navier-Stokes for
 example for fluid-dynamics), but in some cases, when they cannot be
 applied directly without adding phenomenological assumptions or when
 the set of differential equation describing the problem is not amenable
 to any analytical solution (except for relaxed or particular instances)
 numerical solution are required.</P>
<P>Hence, general cases require approximated numerical methods commonly
 based on space-time discretization and permitted to enlarge the set of
 cases which can be carefully simulated. But many others problems are
 still intractable and for those problems is necessary to adopt new
 solutions. Numerical methods have became more popular, as computational
 power raised up in years, and approaches in order to overcome the
 problems regarding differential equations
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@Toffoli1984] were studied, but at the same time new methods that
 exploited principles of parallel computing were adopted either for
 reasons of absolute performance or reasons of cost/performance.</P>
