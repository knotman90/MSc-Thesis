<H2 id="sect:RBBOptimization"><A NAME="10_7">Rectangular Bounding Box -
 RBB</A></H2>
<P>The first adopted strategy utilize a Rectangular Bounding Box (RBB)
 within which all the active cells reside. As the lava flows and invades
 more space it dynamically grows, hence is not necessary to launch as
 many threads as the number of cell in the whole cellular space, but it
 is sufficient to allocate only those ones that compute the transition
 function for the cells within the RBB. This drastically reduces
 execution times, since the sub-rectangle is usually smaller than the
 original CA space, leading to a more efficient utilization of the
 device resources.</P>
<P>For this reason, a GPU optimized CA (GPU-OCA) version has been tested
 that takes into account, at each CA step, the RBB that includes all
 active cells (i.e., cells containing lava) of the automaton. However,
 while in a sequential OCA (CPU-OCA) the CA space matrix is simply
 scanned by considering the RBB boundaries instead of the whole CA, the
 GPU-OCA must consider the rectangular grid bounding box (RGBB)
 containing active cells, which in general includes the traditional RBB
 of active cells (see figure [fig:RBB]).</P>

<P>However, while in a sequential OCA (CPU-OCA) the CA space matrix is
 simply scanned by considering the RBB boundaries instead of the whole
 CA, the GPU-OCA must consider the rectangular grid bounding box (RGBB)
 containing active cells, which in general includes the traditional RBB
 of active cells (Figure [fig:RBB]) that has been implemented storing a
 double copy of an array of 4 indexes that keep trace of the size of the
 rectangle, one for reading and the other for updating. During the
 distribution phase (the only time the RBB may increase its sizes), when
 a newly activated cell resides out of the RBB’s bounds, an atomic
 CUDA operation (<CODE>atomicExch(…)</CODE>) is performed in order to
 update the RBB. At the end of the distribution phase the two arrays are
 swapped, so the subsequent elementary processes will work also on the
 new active cells.</P>
<P>The grid of blocks grows dynamically as the simulation is carried on,
 so at each CA step, the grid of threads readapts itself by creating a
 new block of threads as soon as the RBB is interested by a newly
 activated cell (see figure [fig:RBB]) out of its boundaries. Thus,
 since the overall number of launched kernels is reduced, the
 computational performance of the algorithm improves significantly.</P>
<PRE> <CODE>/*distribution phase terminate here*/
	if(d_nSh[index] &gt; 0 ){	
		if (col &lt;= D_SCAL-&gt;minRect[0]-1)
			atomicExch(&amp;D_SCAL-&gt;minRect[5],col);
		if (col &gt;= D_SCAL-&gt;minRect[1]+1)
			atomicExch(&amp;D_SCAL-&gt;minRect[6],col);
		if (row &lt;= D_SCAL-&gt;minRect[2]-1)
			atomicExch(&amp;D_SCAL-&gt;minRect[7],row);
		if (row &gt;= D_SCAL-&gt;minRect[3]+1)
			atomicExch(&amp;D_SCAL-&gt;minRect[8],row);
	}</CODE></PRE>
<P>Notwithstanding this operation is implemented by means of atomic CUDA
 instructions, it does not represent a bottleneck (atomic operations in
 CUDA have to be used with caution, see section
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
 [@NvidiaprogGuide]) because each RBB update is performed only once (per
 RBB’s side) and, considering that the RBB increases its sizes of
 maximum one unit per dimensions at each CA step, it is easy to see that
 the first cell that updates a border (e.g. <CODE>D_SCAL-&gt;minRect[5]</CODE>
, the top border, for example) disables all the others threads to
 execute further modifications on that variable.</P>
<P>Despite the good performance improvements that were achieved, figure
 [fig:RBBSchreenShot] shows, that in some cases, the RBB approach is not
 optimal<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><SUP>97</SUP></A>
 in limiting the number of IDLE cells. Even within the boundaries of the
 rectangle the percentage of active cells is still low due the box
 expansion policy. The boundaries can be expanded due to the activation
 of a few number of cells (one is sufficient) on the RBB frame, but the
 entire row and column in which they reside will be scheduled for
 execution. For example, regarding figure [fig:RBBSchreenShot], if a
 cell on the bottom right corner was activated, it would produce a RBB
 size increase consisting of a whole column and row despite the
 activation of only one cell.</P>
