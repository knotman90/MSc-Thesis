 Graphics to General Purpose Computing</A></H2>
<P>The concept of many processor working together in concert in not new
 in the graphic field of the computer science. Since the demand
 generated by entertainment started to growth multi-core hardware
 emerged in order to take advantage of the high parallel task of
 generating 3D image. In computer graphics, the process of generating a
 3D images consist of refreshing pixels at rate of sixty or more Hz.
 Each pixel to be processed goes through a number of stages, and this
 process is commonly referred to as the graphic processing pipeline. The
 peculiarity of this task is that the computation each pixel is
 independent of the other’s so this work is perfectly suitable for
 distribution over parallel processing elements. To support extremely
 fast processing of large graphics data sets (vertices and fragments),
 modern GPUs employ a stream processing model with parallelism. The game
 industry boosted the development of the GPU, that offer now greater
 performance than CPUs and are improving faster too (see Figure
 [CPU-VS-GPU_GFLOP] and [CPU-VS-GPU_MEMORY]). The reason behind the
 discrepancy in floating-point capability between CPU and GPU is that
 GPU is designed such that more transistors are devoted to data
 processing rather than caching and flow control.</P>
<P>The today’s Top 500 Supercomputers<A class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10"
id="fnref10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> ranking is dominated by massively
 parallel computer, built on top of superfast networks and millions of
 sequential CPUs working in concert but as the industry is developing
 even more powerful, programmable and capable GPUs in term of GFlops we
 see that they begin to offer advantages over traditional cluster of
 computers in terms of economicity and scalability.</P>
