<P>This way of updating the cellular space, although it does not fit
 perfectly with the theoretical cellular automata model, may be
 considered as an optimization because otherwise a set of nine flow
 substates should be stored and managed to keep track of the substates
 quantities interchanged at each step. Moreover the transition function
 is applied only on cells where the thickness substate value
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(sh_{cell} &gt; 0 \). The cellular space could be formed by a very large
 number of cells (for example we applied the model to a discretization
 of a flank of Mount Etna corresponding to a
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(517 \times 378 = 195426\) cells cellular space), but in the context
 of “evolutive” phenomena such as volcano eruptions and consequent
 lava flow modelling, that evolve starting from only a limited active
 part of the space and growing as the time passes by, cells that are far
 from lava are considered to be<EM> idle</EM> because they cannot be
 neither sources nor receivers of any lava quantity, consequently
 skipping their computation would not affect the final result. Hence
 minimizing the number of times in which transition function is applied
 on idle cells could be crucial for performances and in a serial
 programming context this can be accomplished easily without any
 overhead. The listing [code:skypIdleCell] shows how a serial
 implementation of the cellular automata loops over the cellular space
 and it selectively applies the transition function whether the <CODE>if</CODE>
 predicate
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(sh_{cell} &gt; 0 \) is true. The most computationally intesive part of
 the transition function is so avoided for such cells.</P>
<PRE> <CODE>for (int x = 0; x &lt; COLS ; x++)
		for (int y = 0; y &lt; ROWS ; y++)
		if (Sh[x][y] &gt; 0 ) {
			...
			/*HEAVY WORK*/
			...</CODE></PRE>
<P>Hence from here it’s clear that the minimization of the idle cells
 computation is an important optimization and we’ll see in sections
 [sect:RBBOptimization] and [sect:linearCellAtomic] that this idea is
 still valid in a parallel context.</P>
