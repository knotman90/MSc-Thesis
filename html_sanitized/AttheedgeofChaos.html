<P>Class 4 automata are at<EM> the edge of chaos</EM> and give a good
 metaphor for the idea that the<EM> interesting</EM> complexity (like
 the one exhibit by biological entities and their interactions or
 analogous to the phase transition between solid and fluid state of the
 matter, is in equilibrium between stability and chaos
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@Langton1990].</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>Perhaps the most exciting implication (of CA representation of
 biological phenomena) is the possibility that life had its origin in
 the vicinity of a phase transition and that evolution reflects the
 process by which life has gained local control over a successively
 greater number of environmental parameters affecting its ability to
 maintain itself at a critical balance point between order and chaos.

<P>Langton in his famous paper,<EM> Computation at the edge of chaos:
 phase transition and emergent computation</EM>
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@Langton1990],was able to identify, simply parametrizing the rule
 space, the various AC classes, the relation between them and to
 “couple” them with the classical complexity classes. He introduced
 the parameter
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\lambda\)
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
[@LangtonThesis1990]that, informally, is simply the fraction of the
 entries in the transition rule table that are mapped the not-quiescent
 state.
<!--span class=&quot;math display&quot;-->
 \[\lambda=\frac{K^N-n_q}{K^N}\] where:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>K is the number of the cell states</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>N the arity of the neighborhood</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<P>
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
\(n_q\) the number of rules mapped to the quiescent state

<P>Langton’s major finding was that a simple measure such as it
 correlates with the system behavior: as it goes from 0 to
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \( 1-\frac{1}{K}\)(respectively the most homogeneous and the most
 heterogeneous rules table scenario), the average behavior of the system
 goes from freezing to periodic patterns to chaos and functions with an
 average value of
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\lambda\) (see
<!--span class=&quot;citation&quot;-->
 [@Langton1990] for a more general discussion) are being on<EM> on the
 edge</EM>(see figure [lambdaWolframClass]).</P>
<P>He studied a entire family of totalistic CA with
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(k=4 \) and
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(N=5\) with
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\lambda\) varying in
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \([0,0.75]\). He was able to determine that values of
<!--span class=&quot;math inline&quot;-->
 \(\lambda\approx0.45\) raise up to class 4 cellular automata.
 Computational system must to provide fundamental properties if it is to
 support computation. Only CA<EM> on the edge</EM> show these properties
 on manipulating and store information data. Here the properties that a
 computational system as to provide:</P>
<DL>
<DT>Storage</DT>
<DD>
<P>
<BR> Storage is the ability of the system of preserving information for
 arbitrarily long times</P>
</DD>
<DT>Transmission</DT>
<DD>
<P>
<BR> Transmission is the propagation of the information in the form of
 signals over arbitrarily long distance</P>
</DD>
<DT>Modification</DT>
<DD>
<P>
<BR> Stored and transmitted information is the mutual possible
 modification of two signals.</P>
</DD>
</DL>
<P>Storage is coupled with less entropy of the system, but transmission
 and modification are not. Few entropy is associated with CA of Class 1
 and 2 and high entropy with class 3. Class 4 is something in between,
 the cells cooperate and are correlate each other, but not too much
 otherwise they would be overly dependent with one mimicking the other
 supporting computation in all its aspects and requirements. Moreover
 class 4 CA are very dependent from the initial configuration opening to
 the possibility to encode programs in it.</P>
